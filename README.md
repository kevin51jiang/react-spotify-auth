  return (
    <div className='app'>
      {token ? (
        <SpotifyApiContext.Provider value={token}>
          {/* Your Spotify Code here */}
          <p>You are authorized with token: {token}</p>

## API

### SpotifyAuth

Here's some props that can be used to customize the button. Please enter your own values for `redirectUri` and `clientID`, otherwise your project may not work correctly.

| Name            | Required | Default                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | :------: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `redirectUri`   |    ✅    | `http://localhost:3000`                    | Spotify redirect URI. In most cases, this is the URL of your webpage. _It must be set in your Developer Console_.                                                                     |
| `clientID`      |    ✅    |                                            | Spotify app Client ID. Can be found from the Spotify Developer Console.                                                                                                               |
| `scopes`        |          | `['user-read-private', 'user-read-email']` | _Array_ of camelCased equivalent for the scopes you are requesting. For example, if you wanted the scope `user-read-recently-played` you can enter `[Scopes.userReadRecentlyPlayed]`. |
| `onAccessToken` |          | `(token) => {}`                            | Function that gets triggered when the component recognizes an access token after an auth grant. Is called with the parameter `accessToken`.                                           |
| `title`         |          | "Continue with Spotify"                    | Message inside the button.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `btnClassName`  |          | style included in package                  | Class(es) that is given to the button.                                                                                                                                                |
| `logoClassName` |          | style included in package                  | Class(es) given to the svg that draws the Spotify logo. _Make sure to add a width if you use a custom class, otherwise it will not appear._                                           |
| `noLogo`        |          | `false`                                    | Removes the Spotify logo from the button.                                                                                                                                             |
| `localStorage`  |          | `false`                                    | Uses `window.localStorage` as a method to store the token. Note that localstorage does not have an expiry.                                                                            |
| `noCookie`      |          | `false`                                    | When true, it does not store the auth token in a cookie named `SpotifyAuthToken`                                                                                                      |
| `showDialog`      |          | `false`                                  | Whether or not to force the user to approve the app again if they’ve already done so. If false (default), a user who has already approved the application may be automatically redirected to the URI specified by redirect_uri. If true, the user will not be automatically redirected and will have to approve the app again.                                                                                                      |

### SpotifyAuthListener

A simplified version of the `SpotifyAuth` component, returning nothing but still listening for any tokens that it might get.

| Name            | Required | Default         | Description                                                                                |
| --------------- | :------: | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `onAccessToken` |          | `(token) => {}` | Function that gets called when an access token is found                                    |
| `localStorage`  |          | `false`         | When true, it will also store the token in `window.localStorage` under `spotifyAuthToken`. |
| `noCookie`      |          | `false`         | When true, it does not store the auth token in a cookie named `SpotifyAuthToken`           |

```jsx
// place this on a page that you will redirect to
// if a <SpotifyAuth /> component isn't there already.
<SpotifyAuthListener />
```

## Scopes

As indicated in the table above, scopes are accessible by the camelCased name given by Spotify. A full list can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/) along with their descriptions. These are included in the package mainly to help autocomplete and prevent annoying typos.

```jsx
import { Scopes } from 'react-spotify-auth'

console.log(Scopes.appRemoteControl) // -> 'app-remote-control'
```

## Persistence

Logging in every time a user wants to use your service is annoying.

To solve that problem, an entry is added to the user's cookies under `spotifyAuthToken`. As per Spotify docs, it has an expiration time of 2 hours after which the token will stop working. If you want to disable the cookie, you can pass in the prop `noCookie`.

You can access it directly through [cookies.get()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies/get) or through a library like [js-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie).

If you prefer working with the [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), a prop of `localStorage` can be passed into the component, which can be accessed at `spotifyAuthToken`. Keep in mind however, that this does not offer the 2h expiry window.
